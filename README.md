# Miwok

Animal species can become endangered, but what about languages?
Around 80 percent of the worldâ€™s population speaks just 20 percent of its 7,000 languages. That means most languages are used by small communities.
A language can eventually reach a point where it loses all of its speakers. When that happens, the knowledge and traditions that are passed down through it are lost as well.
The Miwok or Miwokan languages, also known as Moquelumnan or Miwuk, are a group of endangered languages spoken in central California by the Miwok peoples, ranging from the Bay Area to the Sierra Nevada.
Here is a Miwok Learning app that I have made. This app teaches you the most common words on the ancient Miwok language
words related to family members, numbers, colors, and common phrases.
It's basically part of what I have learnt from the Udacity Android course.
